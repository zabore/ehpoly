# riskclustr

`riskclustr` is a collection of functions related to the study of
etiologic heterogeneity both across disease subtypes and across
individual tumor markers. The included functions allow one to quantify
the extent of etiologic heterogeneity in the context of a case-control
study, and provide p-values to test for etiologic heterogeneity across
individual risk factors.

## Installation

You can install the production version of `riskclustr` with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zabore/riskclustr")
```

and the development version with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zabore/riskclustr", ref = "development")
```
